## Data Analytics Week at the AWS Loft

Data Analytics Week at the AWS Loft is an opportunity to learn about Amazon’s broad and deep family of managed analytics services. These services provide easy, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective ways to manage your data in the cloud.

## 2019 Labs


[Analyzing Data Streams](https://github.com/wrbaldwin/da-week/blob/master/Labs/Analyzing-Data-Streams.md) - We will build a streaming data pipeline using Amazon Kinesis services. We will generate and ingest data, then perform real-time anomaly detection on it. You will need a laptop with Firefox or Chrome browser for this lab.

## Old Labs


[Redshift Basics](https://github.com/wrbaldwin/da-week/blob/master/Labs/Redshift-Basics.md) -
In this workshop, you will set up a Redshift cluster, load data from multiple sources, and run analytic queries. You’ll need a laptop with a Firefox or Chrome browser.

[Visualizing Redshift](https://github.com/wrbaldwin/da-week/blob/master/Labs/Visualizing-Redshift.md) - In this workshop, you will set up a QuickSight account, then visualize the data you entered in the “Using Redshift” Hands-on Lab. You will need a Mac or Windows computer with a Firefox or Chrome browser.

[Amazon Athena & Glue](Labs/Athena/index.md) - In this lab, we will be using different public datasets to demonstrate how to create  tables from the data, query and visualize them using services such as  Amazon Athena, and AWS Glue.

[Voice Powered Analytics](https://github.com/awslabs/voice-powered-analytics) - In this workshop, you will build an Alexa skill that queries metrics from a data lake, which you will define. The goal after leaving this workshop, is for you to understand how to uncover Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from a data set, build and automate queries for measuring those KPIs, and access them via Alexa voice-enabled devices. Startups can make available voice powered analytics to query at any time, and Enterprises can deliver these types of solutions to stakeholders so they can have easy access to the Business KPIs that are top of mind.

[Log Analytics](https://github.com/wrbaldwin/da-week/blob/master/Labs/Log-Analytics.md) - In this workshop, you will get started with Amazon Elasticsearch Service: creating clusters, cluster node configurations, storage configurations, and Identity Access Manager (IAM) Policies.

[Stream Analytics](https://github.com/wrbaldwin/da-week/blob/master/Labs/Stream-Analytics.md) - We'll create streams with Amazon DynamoDB and analyze them in real time with Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics.. You’ll need a laptop with a Firefox or Chrome.
